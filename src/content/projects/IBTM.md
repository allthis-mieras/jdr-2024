Joined by his father Tony, filmmaker Olivier Garcia travels to the US to reunite with his half-brother Erik, who is just released from jail.

Sharing the same blood, but resembling little in age, character and upbringing, the triangle of Garcia men try to make the best of what is supposed to be a male bonding experience. Part home and part road movie, In Between These Mountains is a trip through the US and the emotional landscape of men burdened by a history of migration.
