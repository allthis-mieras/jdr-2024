Fortuyn: Un Dutch tells the story of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn from a bicultural perspective. Both in archival footage and interviews, we shift the narrative of Fortuyn by taking the viewpoint of people with a bicultural background as our starting point.

How has the right-wing turn initiated by Fortuyn shaped their lives in the multicultural society he declared bankrupt? And which political and societal events influenced the resurgence of Islamophobia that Fortuyn initiated? The series is history retold; how we remember our history depends on who we allow to tell the story.
