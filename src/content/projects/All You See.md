What if from one day to the next you're not seen anymore, but you are being stared at?

The four protagonists in this film have suddenly ended up in a new world full of alienation. They are all 'new' in the Netherlands, but soon find out that in the eyes of others, they will forever be seen as newcomers. Even after 35 years.
