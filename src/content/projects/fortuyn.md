Fortuyn: Un Dutch tells the story of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn from a bicultural perspective. Both in archival footage and interviews, we shift the narrative of Fortuyn by taking the viewpoint of people with a bicultural background as our starting point.

How has Fortuyn's right-wing turn shaped lives in the multicultural society he declared bankrupt? What political and societal events influenced the Islamophobia resurgence he initiated? This series revisits history; our memory depends on who tells the story.
