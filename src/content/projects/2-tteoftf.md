description: |
  As the child of Palestinian parents from a homeland shaped by war, Sakir Khader is torn between two worlds, carrying traumas passed down from generation to generation. Through the Eye of the Falcon is a raw and intimate family epic in which he explores how the occupation of Palestine—and the physical and psychological violence inextricably linked to it—has marked his family for generations, both in Palestine and in the Netherlands. As the ongoing reality of war and violence increasingly places his dangerous work as a photographer and filmmaker at odds with his family life, he reflects his own experiences against those of his immediate family, resulting in a family and self-portrait that lays bare a cycle of disrupted fatherhood.
